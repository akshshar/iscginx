# iscginx
ISC DHCP server and NGINX in a docker container to run PXE servers on IOS-XR boxes

# Build Docker image

Adjust the required isc-dhcp configs and nginx configs under the `overlay/defaults/` directory.

Now build Docker image locally:

```
docker build -t akshshar/iscginx .

```

# Set up the configuration on Router

If you're trying to use the router itself as a PXE server for other devices on the LAN, then you may require multiple physical ports associated with a bridge domain in the configuration. 

Note: For all releases of IOS-XR < 7.4.1, only untagged interfaces associated with a bridge domain are supported for Linux applications.

A sample configuration is shown below. Play around with it and adjust based on your requirement:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show running-config  l2vpn 
Thu Oct 29 08:51:24.677 UTC
l2vpn
 bridge group Test
  bridge-domain 100
   interface FourHundredGigE0/0/0/0
   !
   routed interface BVI100
   !
  !
 !
!

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show running-config  interface FourHundredGigE 0/0/0/0
Thu Oct 29 08:51:35.785 UTC
interface FourHundredGigE0/0/0/0
 l2transport
 !
!

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#


```

With the above configuration, BVI100 interface should be up in XR and will appear as BV100 in the Linux kernel of the router:

```

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show l2vpn bridge-domain bd-name 100
Thu Oct 29 08:53:22.698 UTC
Legend: pp = Partially Programmed.
Bridge group: Test, bridge-domain: 100, id: 0, state: up, ShgId: 0, MSTi: 0

  Filter MAC addresses: 0
  ACs: 2 (2 up), VFIs: 0, PWs: 0 (0 up), PBBs: 0 (0 up), VNIs: 0 (0 up)
  List of ACs:
    BV100, state: up, BVI MAC addresses: 1
    FH0/0/0/0, state: up, Static MAC addresses: 0
  List of Access PWs:
  List of VFIs:
  List of Access VFIs:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#

```
Check the interface in XR kernel by dropping into the bash shell:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#bash
Thu Oct 29 08:54:15.183 UTC
[ios:~]$
[ios:~]$ifconfig BV100
BV100     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 78:6e:f5:7a:29:05  
          inet addr:10.1.1.20  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:133258 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:91606 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:199096568 (189.8 MiB)  TX bytes:6213708 (5.9 MiB)

[ios:~]$

```

Perfect! Now you can spin up the Docker container and start the DHCP and NGINX servers on the BV100 interface to serve devices connecting to the router over the bridge-domain L2 interfaces (like FourHundredGigE0/0/0/0 in the above example).

# Spin up the Docker container to start your own PXE server

Use --net=host to run the docker container in the "default/global" VRF where the BV100 interface was created earlier.
Also change into the `/misc/disk1` directory before using the docker run commandbelow to ensure your mount points have enough disk space.

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#bash
Thu Oct 29 08:45:37.555 UTC
[ios:~]$ cd /misc/disk1
[ios:~]$ docker run -itd --name iscginx \
                --net=host \
                -v "$(pwd)/config:/config" \
                -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
                -e PUID=`id -u` \
                -e PGID=`id -g` \
                akshshar/iscginx

```

Make sure the Docker container is running:

```

[ios:~]$docker ps

# Test your PXE server!

In the demo setup, we have a Linux box with interface eth1 connected to FourHundregGig0/0/0/0 port of the Cisco8201 device as seen in the lldp outputs below:

```

## Testing the DHCP server on the router

With the iscginx docker container running on the router, let's issue a dhclient request on the eth1 interface of the connected linux box to see if things work:

```
[root@localhost iscginx]# dhclient eth1
[root@localhost iscginx]# 


```

With the real-time docker logs on the router, we should see the request come in:

```

```

Checking on the requesting interface eth1, we see the required IP address assigned by the DHCP server running inside the docker container on the router:

```
[root@localhost iscginx]# ifconfig eth1
eth1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.1.1.30  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.1.1.0

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0


```

## Testing the NGINX server

Create files in the Router shell with a directory structure as described in your nginx.conf file found at the root of this repository. 
The default nginx.conf supports a directory structure with root `/data/`
and subdirectories: `/data/images` and `/data/configs/`

With the default nginx.conf in play, we create a couple of files on the router in the following file/directory structure based on the mount point (see `docker run` command above where we mount $(pwd) or `/misc/disk1/data` to `~/data` inside the container:


```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#bash
Thu Oct 29 09:27:48.621 UTC
[ios:~]$
[ios:~]$cd /misc/disk1/
[ios:/misc/disk1]$
[ios:/misc/disk1]$tree data
data
|-- configs
|   `-- rtr.conf
`-- images
    `-- image.iso

2 directories, 2 files
[ios:/misc/disk1]$

```

Now with the IP address already received via the DHCP interactions earlier, issue an HTTP request to download your required files from the NGINX server on the router:

```

[root@localhost iscginx]# wget http://10.1.1.20:8080/images/image.iso
--2020-10-29 02:30:27--  http://10.1.1.20:8080/images/image.iso

```
